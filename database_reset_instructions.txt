HOW TO RESET RENDER DATABASE
============================

1. CONNECT TO DATABASE
--------------------
Copy and paste this command in PowerShell:

$env:PGPASSWORD="KhxNXt2AwQMLvcJDxkvfQE4OOZoCeotF"
psql -h dpg-d086l0s9c44c73bjbu5g-a.singapore-postgres.render.com -U mainventory_postgres_1pyc_user mainventory_postgres_1pyc


2. RESET DATABASE
---------------
After you see the prompt "mainventory_postgres_1pyc=>", type:

\i reset.sql


3. VERIFY RESET (Optional)
------------------------
Check if tables are empty by typing:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM product_catalog;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM current_stock;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales;

All should return 0.


4. EXIT DATABASE
--------------
Type this to exit:

\q


IF YOU DON'T HAVE reset.sql
==========================
Create a new file named "reset.sql" with this content:

BEGIN;

-- Delete in reverse order of dependencies
DELETE FROM bulk_logs;
DELETE FROM box_number;
DELETE FROM sales;
DELETE FROM lent;
DELETE FROM broken;
DELETE FROM logs;
DELETE FROM current_stock;
DELETE FROM in_stock;
DELETE FROM invoice;
DELETE FROM lent_id;
DELETE FROM broken_id;
DELETE FROM barcode_status;
DELETE FROM product_catalog;
-- Not deleting from users table to preserve login credentials

COMMIT;


IMPORTANT NOTES
==============
- This reset preserves user accounts
- Make sure you have backups if needed
- Password might change - check Render dashboard for current password
- Always verify reset was successful
