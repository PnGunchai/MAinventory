## Recently Implemented Features

### Lent Item Workflow Enhancement

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive lent item management workflow with the following capabilities:

1. **Create Lent Orders**: 
   - Create lent orders with multiple products
   - Support for both serialized and non-serialized items
   - Product-specific split pair functionality for SN=2 items

2. **View Lent Orders**:
   - Retrieve all items in a specific lent order
   - Track status of each lent item

3. **Update Lent Item Status**:
   - Process returns and sales in a single API call
   - Mark individual items as either "returned" or "sold"
   - Optionally specify sales order IDs for sold items
   - System maintains data integrity by:
     - Creating proper sales records for sold items
     - Using original shop name for consistency
     - Preserving full history in lent records

4. **Broken Item Handling**:
   - Individual declaration of broken items
   - Required explicit product barcode specification
   - No auto-fill or auto-generation of product barcodes
   - Optional splitPair parameter for paired items

## Proposed Enhancements

### Batch Scanning

**Current Limitation**: Staff must process items individually or create structured JSON requests, which is time-consuming for large operations.

**Proposed Solution**: Implement a simplified "scan stream" API that accepts a continuous flow of scanned barcodes and processes them based on the current operation mode.

#### Implementation Details

1. **New Batch Scan API Endpoint**
   ```
   POST /api/batch-scan
   ```
   ```json
   {
     "mode": "lent-returns",
     "employeeId": "EMP101",
     "orderId": "LENT001",
     "note": "Customer return batch",
     "defaultStatus": "returned",
     "barcodes": [
       "PROD001",
       "PROD002",
       "PROD003",
       "PROD004"
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Operation Modes**
   - `lent-returns`: Process items as returns from a lent order
   - `lent-sales`: Process items as sales from a lent order
   - `stock-add`: Add items to inventory
   - `stock-check`: Verify items exist in inventory
   - `stock-count`: Count inventory against expected levels

3. **Barcode Override Syntax**
   Allow special prefixes to override the default action:
   - `S:PROD005` to mark as sold (when default is return)
   - `R:PROD006` to mark as returned (when default is sold)
   - `Q5:BOX001` to indicate quantity of 5 for non-serialized items

4. **Error Handling**
   - Continue processing the batch even if some items fail
   - Return a detailed report of successes and failures
   - Allow "resume" functionality to retry failed items

#### Benefits
- **Speed**: Process 50-100 items per minute vs. 5-10 with individual API calls
- **Reduced Errors**: Less manual data entry means fewer mistakes
- **Offline Support**: Mobile apps could queue scans if connectivity is lost

### Mobile Optimization

**Current Limitation**: The existing API is optimized for desktop applications but not for mobile devices with limited bandwidth, intermittent connectivity, and smaller screens.

**Proposed Solution**: Create a dedicated mobile API layer with lightweight responses, bandwidth-efficient patterns, and offline-first capabilities.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Lightweight Response Format**
   - Stripped-down JSON with only essential fields
   - Pagination controls to limit payload size
   - Support for partial responses (fields selection)
   ```
   GET /api/mobile/items/PROD001?fields=status,location
   ```

2. **Smart Caching Headers**
   - Implement ETag and If-None-Match headers
   - Use HTTP 304 responses when data hasn't changed
   - Cache-Control headers for common lookup data

3. **Batch Upload/Download**
   - Allow uploading cached operations when connectivity returns
   - Support downloading work orders for offline processing
   - Compressed data formats for bandwidth savings

4. **Mobile-Specific Endpoints**
   - Single-purpose endpoints with minimal parameters
   - QR code generation API for item labeling
   - Image recognition support for damaged items

5. **Progressive Enhancement**
   ```
   GET /api/mobile/scan/PROD001
   ```
   Returns all common information needed after scanning in a single request:
   ```json
   {
     "item": {
       "barcode": "PROD001",
       "name": "Wireless Headphones",
       "status": "in_stock",
       "location": "Shelf A3",
       "image_url": "https://..."
     },
     "actions": {
       "lend": "/api/mobile/lend/PROD001",
       "sell": "/api/mobile/sell/PROD001",
       "details": "/api/mobile/details/PROD001"
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Simplified Authentication**
   - Long-lived API tokens for device-specific access
   - Fingerprint/biometric integration for secure login
   - Role-based access tailored to mobile users
