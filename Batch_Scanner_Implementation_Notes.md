# Batch Scanner Implementation Notes

This document captures the key points from our discussion about implementing a batch scanning feature for the inventory management system. These notes will serve as a reference when we revisit this feature after completing the current project plan.

## Overview

The batch scanning feature aims to streamline inventory operations by allowing continuous scanning of multiple items without manual form submission between each scan. Primary use cases include inventory additions and sales processing.

## Key Use Cases

1. **Inventory Addition**
   - Rapid addition of new stock
   - Support for both serialized and non-serialized items
   - Real-time validation and feedback

2. **Sales Processing**
   - Quick creation of sales orders
   - Support for quantity notation for non-serialized items
   - Integration with existing splitPair functionality

## Technical Approaches

### Integration Options

1. **Wrapper Around Existing APIs**
   - Use batch scanning as an alternative input method
   - Collect scans and submit to existing bulk endpoints
   - Preserve current business logic

2. **Real-time Processing**
   - Process each scan immediately
   - Provide instant feedback
   - May be less efficient than batching

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Validate each scan in real-time
   - Collect items and submit in small batches (5-10 items)
   - Balance between feedback speed and processing efficiency

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Frontend Requirements**
   - Auto-focusing input field
   - Clear visual feedback (success/error indicators)
   - Session management for collected scans
   - Error handling and recovery

2. **Backend Integration**
   - Leveraging existing endpoints:
     - `/api/stock/add-bulk` for inventory additions
     - `/api/sales` for sales order creation
   - Maintaining business rules for:
     - SN=2 paired products
     - Split pair functionality
     - Non-serialized quantity handling

3. **Special Syntax Support**
   - `BOX001:5` for non-serialized items with quantity
   - `S:BARCODE` for overriding split pair defaults

## User Interface Concept

```
[MODE: ADD INVENTORY] [EMPLOYEE ID: EMP123] [START SCANNING]

Items Scanned:
✅ BOX001 (Tennis Racket) - Added 5 items
✅ PROD123 (Wireless Headphones) - Added 1 item
❌ PROD125 - ERROR: Duplicate barcode

[6 ITEMS ADDED] [1 ERROR] [FINISH SESSION]
```

## Code Integration Example

```javascript
// Simplified pseudocode for batch scanning implementation
let sessionItems = [];

function onBarcodeScan(barcodeInput) {
  // Process input (handle special syntax)
  const { barcode, quantity, splitPair } = parseBarcode(barcodeInput);
  
  // Add to session collection
  sessionItems.push({
    identifier: barcode,
    quantity: quantity || 1,
    splitPair: splitPair
  });
  
  // Validate scan (could be async call to backend)
  const validationResult = validateScan(barcode, quantity);
  
  // Update UI with result
  updateScanResults(barcode, validationResult);
  
  // Re-focus input for next scan
  focusScanInput();
}

function completeSession() {
  // Submit collected items to appropriate endpoint
  return fetch('/api/batch-process', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      mode: currentMode,
      items: sessionItems,
      employeeId: currentEmployeeId,
      additionalInfo: getAdditionalInfo()
    })
  });
}
```

## Development Priorities

When implementing this feature in the future, the suggested order is:

1. Create basic web-based scanning interface
2. Implement sales processing flow (likely simpler)
3. Add inventory addition functionality
4. Enhance with additional features:
   - Offline support
   - Mobile optimization
   - Advanced error handling

## Decision Points for Future Implementation

1. **Platform**: Web-based vs. dedicated mobile app
2. **Processing Model**: Real-time vs. batch collection
3. **API Strategy**: Use existing endpoints vs. create scanner-specific endpoints

## Next Steps

1. Complete current project plan priorities
2. Revisit batch scanning as an enhancement feature
3. Conduct user research with staff to refine requirements
4. Create detailed technical specification based on these notes
5. Develop prototype for testing

These notes capture our discussion about the batch scanning feature, which will be implemented as an extra feature after completing the current project plan.
